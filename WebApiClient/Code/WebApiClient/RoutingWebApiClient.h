 A @c WebApiClient that delegates all calls to another @c WebApiClient based on route names.
 This allows different clients to be used for different routes, without the consumer of the
 @c WebApiClient having to deal with different clients.
 
 Simply configure the @c clients dictionary with a mapping of route names to other client
 instances, and then use this client anywhere needed.
